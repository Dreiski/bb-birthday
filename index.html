                I had no idea what to get you for today considering that we are far apart right now. So ito yung naisip koo. It's just a simple website dedicated to you.  
                It's a short message and QR codes that lead you somewhere. I hope you like it!
            </h3>

               Hello! I will be sending this to you at exactly 12:01 am on July 2. I am also guessing that you are still awake at this time because your body clock ain't fixed yet HAHAHA. 
               I am definitely more excited for your birthday than mine.
               I want to tell you how grateful I am to you. Being with you makes me feel like everything will be alright. Your presence alone brings peace in my mind.
                Your smile always makes my day.  Even though we are far away from each right now, I can stil feel the warmth and closeness we share.
                I wish you realize how special you are to me and to others around you.
                I wish for more birthdays with you. Always take care of yourself! I miss youuu! 
                Happy birthday ulit bb and I hope you enjoy your day!
